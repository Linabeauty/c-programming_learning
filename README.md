						C PROGRAMMING LNAGUAGE SELF REVISION


C programming is a programming language developed in the early 1970s. It is a low-level programming language that allows programmers to write efficient and portable code. Here are some important keywords related to C programming:

Syntax: C programming has a specific syntax and grammar that must be followed to write correct code.

Variables: Variables are used to store and manipulate data in C. They have specific data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, etc.

Functions: C allows the creation of functions, which are blocks of code that perform specific tasks. Functions can be called and reused throughout the program.

Control Structures: C provides control structures like if-else statements, loops (such as for, while, and do-while), and switch-case statements to control the flow of execution in a program.

Pointers: Pointers are variables that store memory addresses. They allow efficient manipulation of data and dynamic memory allocation in C.

Arrays: Arrays are used to store a collection of elements of the same type. They provide a way to access and manipulate multiple values using a single variable.

Libraries: C has a rich collection of libraries that provide pre-written code for various tasks. These libraries can be included in a program to add functionality.

Input/Output: C provides input/output functions for reading input from the user and displaying output to the screen or other devices.

Structs: Structs allow the creation of custom data types that can hold multiple variables of different types. They are useful for organizing related data.

File Handling: C supports file input/output operations, allowing programs to read from and write to files on disk.

These provide a glimpse into the essential aspects of C programming, but there is much more to explore in this versatile language.
