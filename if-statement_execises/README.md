THE IF STATEMENT IN C PROGRAMMING

C has the following conditional statements: Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true. Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false. Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.

It is used to compare things and take some action based on the comparison. Relational and logical operators supports this comparison.

C language supports three variants of if statement.

1. Simple if statement
2. if else and if…else…if statement
3. Nested if…else statement
